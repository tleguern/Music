# Songs

This repository contains a collection of music scores of various origins and for various instruments. I transcribed all of them using Lilypond.

## How to build

This project is buildable through BSD make. On Linux-based system it
might be available as the `pmake' command.

You also need Lilypond >= 2.14.2.

## Bombarde

In the _bombarde_ directory are music scores written for the [bombarde][1] in _si_â™­ major (or B-flat major).
